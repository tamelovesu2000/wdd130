            Hello! My name is Otame ThankGod and I am from Ozoro. I enjoyed my stay thereâ€”it's a place that always feels
            like home. By the grace of God, I was privileged to study Chemical Engineering at the university. With the
            help of BYU and their quest to make the world a better place, I see this as a lifetime opportunity, and I
            want to make the best use of it. Glory be to God.

            Nigeria, a country located in West Africa, is a melting pot of diverse cultures, traditions, and customs.
            With over 250 ethnic groups, each with its unique language, beliefs, and practices, Nigerian culture is a
            rich and complex tapestry. One of the defining characteristics of Nigerian culture is hospitality.
            Nigerians are known for their warm welcomes and respect for guests. Visitors are often treated with lavish
            feasts, reflecting the importance of community and social relationships in Nigerian culture.
