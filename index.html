            Hello! My name is Otame ThankGod, and I'm from Ozoro. I've always felt a sense of belonging there - it's a place that truly feels like home. By God's grace, I was privileged to study Chemical Engineering at the university. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of BYU's community, which shares my passion for making a positive impact in the world. I see this as a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and I'm committed to making the most of it. Glory be to God!
